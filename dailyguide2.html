    <title>FIVE IMPORTANT THING EVERY PARENT MUST PASS ON TO THEIR CHILDREN AS AN INHERITANCE</title>
</head>
  <body style="background-color: rgb(190, 226, 226);">
    <h1><i><u><b> Forget about acquisitions, acquisitions are tertiary. The primary goal of lifting use it quickly.  </b></u></i></h1>
    <h2><i>There are five things the bible expects one generation to transfer to the other, in order for that generation to say they have given an inheritance.</i></h2>
   
       <ol type="circle">
        <li><em>The first thing that is qualified to be called an inheritance that every father must transfer to his children, every leader must transfer to his subordinates is your convictions.
            Your convictions are a summation of your philosophies, your believes, and your mindset.
            So the first thing you need to pass on as an inheritance is/are your convictions. Genesis 18:17-20. The moment you want success for your life, or continuity for your life, the first gift you have to leave is your convictions. if you cannot transfer your convictions to your subordinates then you’ve not transferred an inheritance.
            
            INHERITANCE
            To inherit means to receive by succession, to receive by will as an err.
            An inheritance is an acquisition of a possession from past generations to the next generation. Deuteronomy 6:1- 22.
            You never reproduce a man’s results until you are able to produce his philosophies and his convictions.
            The first and most importance thing that is qualified to be called an inheritance is your Convictions.
            Be sure you leave a conviction of quality results or mindset.
            Age does not equals transformation.
            . Every great man you admire, seek to find out their philosophies.
            Behind their philosophies is the results to their succession.
            
            Culture your children to understand that giving them physical thing is not yet an inheritance, it is the transference of believe.
            
            </em></li>
    <li><em>The second thing that is qualified to be called an inheritance is your Name.
        Your name means your credibility, your name means your track record, your name means your impacts, your name means your values and your contributions.
        Genesis 12:2.
        The difference between being great and having a great name.
        When you are great, you are great for yourself but when you have a great name other people or generations can use it as a leverage.
        Example ; Luis Vitton, Gucci etc.
        At the end of your life, your name will either be a key or a padlock. There is no being neutral.
        Your name will lock the doors and destinies of people, multiplying hardship or it will open doors for them.
        It is not only the name of Jesus that is powerful, the name of a man is his track record, his credibility.
        You are a failure truly if you cannot transfer your name.
        The name you have carries within it favor.
        There are people who may not have physical money but their children will never beg for food because even though they were cleaners, their integrity gave them a name.
        The world that we live in now, most people will be lifted by the name they carry than just their intellectual investment.
        Names can be a leverage.
        Jesus gave us His name. when God makes your name great, even when you are not there, other people can come and use that name.
        Your name is not just an initial.
        Everyday you leave your life, you are making an investment to your name. 
        There are some people the way they live their life now, they are not yet seeing the effect. It is when their children come then you will know you have spent your life investing pain for your children. Do not pride in being a wicked person, you are programming pain for your children.
        
        There are many people the way they are leaving their life except God intervenes, their children are already in trouble. 
        Proverbs 22:1, Ecclesiastes 7:1
        A good name can buy riches but riches cannot buy a good name.
        </em></li>
     <li><em>The third inheritance that must be transferred is your relationships and your connections.
        John 19:26-27
        Relationships are a potent leverage.
        Who hates you does not matter, who likes you matters? You have not transferred real wealth until you transfer your relationships and connections.
        Every man is made perfect by his relationships.
        God blesses men through men.
        Do not down play the power of relationships.
